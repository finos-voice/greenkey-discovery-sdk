# Example custom folders for Discovery

Each example contains a folder labeled `custom`, which in turn contains the needed `intents.json` and `entities` folder for launching Discovery.
Some examples contain a `schemas.json` file to customize the return json.
They also contain example scripts to see how the particular configuration will detect entities.
Feel free to use these examples as a jumping off point in your own code.
